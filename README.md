🔍 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end healthcare claims analytics solution focused on understanding claim denials, processing efficiency, and revenue impact across service categories and geographies.

Using structured claims data, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboards, the project translates raw claims data into actionable business insights that can support operational, financial, and compliance-driven decision-making in a healthcare environment.

🧠 Business Problem

Healthcare claims operations often face challenges such as:

High claim denial rates impacting revenue

Limited visibility into why claims are denied

Variations in processing efficiency across services and regions

Reactive handling of high-value or high-risk claims

This project addresses questions such as:

Where are denials concentrated — by service, region, or time?

How do claim amounts compare with allowed amounts?

Which services drive the highest operational and revenue risk?

Are processing timelines improving or deteriorating?

❓ Key Business Questions Answered
1. Where are claim denials concentrated?

Certain service categories contribute disproportionately to denied revenue

Geographic analysis highlights states with higher denial impact

2. What is the revenue impact of denials?

Comparison of claim amount vs allowed amount highlights cost-control effectiveness

High-value claims represent a small volume but a significant revenue risk

3. How efficient is the claims process?

Average processing days vary noticeably by claim status

Trend analysis helps identify periods of operational slowdown

4. Which services require attention?

Service-level breakdown reveals categories with higher denial rates and longer processing times
